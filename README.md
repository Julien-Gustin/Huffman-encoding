# Huffman by Gustin Julien & Carlisi Mathias
## Using the HUFFMAN program

* Get into the repectory "Huffman_Gustin_Carlisi/"
* Then type make = {heap, list}
  - heap if you want to use an heap priority queue
  - list if you want to use a list priority queue
* then compile by using
  - make c for encoding
  - make d for decoding



### NB
* ###### The encoding file will be in the Repectory ../Encode
* ###### The decoding file will be in the Repectory ../Decode
* ###### If you want to encode/decode your own txt file just let your file in ../source and then replace the FILENAME in the makefile by your file.txt
